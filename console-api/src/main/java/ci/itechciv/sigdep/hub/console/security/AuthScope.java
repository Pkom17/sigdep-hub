/**
 * Resolves the geo scope for the current request by combining:
 *   - the role-based ceiling encoded in the JWT (regionId/districtId/siteId
 *     claims for users who are bound to a specific zone),
 *   - the optional UI-supplied scope (?regionId=…&districtId=…&siteId=…).
 *
 * The JWT scope is the *upper bound*: if a user is a {@code DISTRICT_COORD}
 * for district 7, narrowing further via the UI is allowed (selecting one
 * site within that district), but broadening is silently clamped back to
 * the JWT scope. So an unauthorized broaden attempt becomes a no-op rather
 * than an error — the UI just shows what the user is allowed to see.
 *
 * Roles that are NOT zone-bound (SUPER_ADMIN, IT_ADMIN, NATIONAL_VIEWER,
 * AUDITOR, ANALYST) accept the UI scope as-is.
 *
 * Dev profile note: when no JWT is in the SecurityContext (the case under
 * the {@code dev} security filter that bypasses auth), the JWT ceiling is
 * "none" and the UI scope passes through. That preserves smoke-test ergonomics.
